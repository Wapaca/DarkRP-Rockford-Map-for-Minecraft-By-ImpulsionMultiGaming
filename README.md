### DarkRP Minecraft MAP

This is a reproduction of the rockford map available on Garry's mod in minecraft, it was originally made to make a DarkRP server for MC but as it was taking me a lot of time i couldn't finish the build but only few parts are missing and the main city is done.

### Installation

Copy the darkrp folder into your minecraft saves location (should be ~/.minecraft/saves)

### Version

This map was made with vanilla Minecraft 1.8.8, if you want to use a newer version you may have to convert the world.
